1)How to enable the Development Mode?

If we want to work with the VF pages first we have to enable the development mode else its going to show error as VF page doesnt exist

Ans:-Username=>mysettings=>Personal=>Advanced User Settings=>Edit=>Development Mode

2)In how many ways can we build VF pages?

Ans:-We can build VF pages in four ways

      1.Standard Navigation

      2.URL

      3.Developer Console

      4.Eclipse/Force.comIDE

Standard Navigation : 

   Setup=>Build=>Develop=>Pages=>Newpage

   Url Format :

   https://serverinstance.salesforce.com/apex/pagename

   if page is existing it will open otherwise it will ask you to create

  Developer Console :
 
   UserName=>Developer console=>File=>New=>VF page

  Eclipse:

   1.need to install java in the system
   2.Install the java
   3.Set the environment variables for java

  VisualForce Page:(Sample page in org)

   Every VF page we are creating that should be strict xml format
  
   VF page consists of 
   1. VF Components and
    2.WebScript components


    Anything Represents in this <>tag is called components

   Component can be any
    html or VFComponents ,

   To identify the differences vF Components starts with <apex:Componentname>


Scripting components can be any
html,java script,Angular js,ajax,jquery etc


1.Every component in the VF page should be in Strict XMl format
i.e..,every open tag have a closing tag
ex:<one></one>,<page></page>
   <one/>

2.Every VF page Should start with <apex:page> component


VISual force pages:

1.<apex:sectionHeader>
 
            This will create a header in the page

the attributes are:1)Title
                   2)Subtitle
                   3)Description
                   4)HelpUrl
                   5)Rendered
                   6)PrintUrl

Ex: <apex:sectionHeader title="New page" subtitle="sub page" description="hi this is section header" help="https://www.facebook.com" />

When we want to display data in VF page data should be represented in  expression format

{! expressoin}//whatever the value that is generated from the expression that is displayed in the page

Ex:{!10)==10,{!10+20}==30,{!ISNULL(10)}==false


Global Data:the data which remains same through out the application once the user has loged in that data we call it as global data 

Salesforce have some predefined global variables,all the global vars are predefined by dollar(search google salesforce global variables)

if you want to refer to the global data we have to give it in the form of
syntax:{!$objectName.FieldName}
Ex:{!$User.Name},{!$Profile.Name}

==>Passing the data from url

https://ap1.salesforce.com/apex/pagename?parameter1=value1

When we want to pass more than one parameter ,we have to seperate the parameters using '&'


https://ap1.salesforce.com/apex/pagename?parameter1=value1 & Parameter2 = Value2

   ==>how to read the paramaters from currentpage url

$currentpage:is a global object which is used to read the parameters from the current page

syntax:{! $currentpage.parameters.parametersName}i.e{!$currentpage.parameters.name}
 
Standatd controller:if you want to refer the data from the object into VF page  then define that obj as Standard Controller

Ex:<apex:page StandardController="Account">

how to read the data from the object?

{!objectname.fieldname}

When we want to refer to a particular record we need to pass that record id as a aparameter in the url

Ex:https://ap1.salesforce.com/apex/pagename/?id=recordid

In the VF page data from the object is retreived from the given record in the url


que)What is the difference between 15 digit id and 18 digit id in url?

ans)When we create record in the object salesforce will create 18 digit unique to recognise it

this is a case insensitive
Same 18digit is represented as 15 digit id as case sensitive

Ex:001-1U00000-BGN16 in this 15/18 digit first 3 digit indicates object and last 5 digits indicates record

Q) if the user doesnt have permision of afield can he see that field on vf page?

A)Data on the VF page runs in the User Context(the security model like OWD,Field Level Security,all these are taken into account before we display the data on thepage)

 output components:-


1)<apex:outputlabel>

2)<apex:outputtext>

3)<apex:outputfield> 

<apex:inlineEditSupport>===>this component is used to edit the outfield by clicking on it                                                           o
