Agile Approach:


	We do follow Agile Methodology in our project and we use both Kanban and Scrum in our projects depends on need.
	
	At high level - we have Program Increment (PI), which starts with Planning. During this - we will gather with other teams and discuss the Features that we all want to develop that could help our customer. We do this by writting Features, its dependencies, Complexity (hours) & Priority (business value) and provide Feature Points.
	
	Once the Features are finalized for the PI, we would get together as a Team and participate in Sprint planning meeting. During this we start writting Stories, identifying its dependencies, Complexity (hours) & Priority (business value) and provide story Points.
	
	Also we will identify what Stories we want to work on based on priorities and dependencies for each Sprint.
	
	Once the stories are identified we will start with Design, Development activities and we will start creating tasks to track the progress of various stories.
	
	We will be joining on a daily stand up which will last for about 10 to 15 minutes at the maximum, to talk about
	
		What we did yesterday
		What we are planning to do today
		Any roadblocks in achieveing the planning
		What are my tasks for tomorrow
	
	After each sprint - we have a sprint demo with our Stakeholders. We will be presenting the stories we developed during the sprint and create new stories in backlog based on feedback.
	
	In case we need to do few changes, we will be doing them within sprint as long as time permits.
	
	As we complete 3 sprints, we will have a PI interm demo, where all teams would be presenting the progress of feature and create additional features, stories into their backlog.

	We call this as Inspect, Adapt, ??
