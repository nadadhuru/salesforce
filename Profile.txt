profile:-
 	Profile is the basic access of organisation.
	Ex:sales,Finanace
All users need to have a profile.No user can be created without a profile.
 
Salesforce security is based on three criteria.

1.object Level-->Profile & Permission set
2.Record Level-->Roles & Sharing seetings
3.Field Level-->Field Level Security

**Can You create a profile?
No,we cannot create a profile,we need to clone from the existing profile and then we have to make changes on top of it

Permission Sets:-
		it gives extra permissions to the user apart from all the profile permission
		you  cannot take back access using permission set.it is used only to give extra permission.
one user can have only one profile,but it has multiple permission sets.
